Third, construct a composite weighted index. Once a set of indicators has been identified, these indicators are aggregated to construct a composite index. Often, some indicators vary significantly across a country. One example is the number of poor people living in each district. If such an indicator is combined with other indicators with limited variation, the composite PTI indicator tends to heavily reflect the geographic pattern of the poor population. To avoid this, the PTI standardizes all indicators to have mean and variance of 0 and 1 respectively. These standardized indicators are then combined into a composite index. The PTI aggregates the standardized indicators with weights, which reflect the relative importance of each variable. As the weight of an indicator increases, the geographic distribution of priority areas of PTI is more affected by that indicator. To facilitate the process of choosing which weights to assign to different indicators, the PTI tool includes an interactive online dashboard that creates a map of priority areas based on selection of indicators and weights so that country team members can easily see the implications that changing weights have on the map of priorities.
