# Monitoring

The PTI should not be a static tool but rather should be adjusted according to changing circumstances on the ground or as project objectives evolve. In addition, after project teams identify priority areas, they may face many unexpected challenges and unknown issues in those priority areas. Such context-specific information cannot be systematically collected by surveys or compiled from administrative data, but it is highly valuable information for future project teams. Therefore, identifying priority areas should not be based not solely on the PTI. Project teams should record any challenges or issues they face in a project site so that future project teams can easily draw lessons from past experiences. These critical pieces of contextual information will be analyzed through case studies and, if appropriate, through statistical and econometric methods to inform future project design and targeting decisions.
