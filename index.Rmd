# Introduction

Tracking how the World Bank’s portfolio of activities aligns with evolving circumstances in specific countries is challenging. World Bank teams engage with countries through important strategic and prioritization exercises, such as the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD). To maximize the development benefits of activities identified under these activities, it is essential to ensure that projects and programs evolve with changing circumstances while reaching the areas that are most in need.

The Project Targeting Index (PTI) offers a framework for project and country teams to match objectives with geographic project site selection. Teams can ensure that project site selection aligns with the country strategy, and the country management unit (CMU) can monitor consistency between project sites and the country strategy. Spatially targeting the Bank’s interventions based on objective criteria and evidence also helps inject transparency into project site selection and promote efficiency in reaching intended beneficiaries. Teams can use the PTI online dashboard,  which serves both as a database of subnational indicators and as a user-friendly tool for PTI calculation, to track fast-changing emergency situations. 
 
The purpose of this guideline is to provide a guideline on how to create a PTI dashboard. It breaks down the process of building a PTI dashboard into four different phases as shown in the diagram below. The book consists of four chapters that correspond to these four steps: [Identification (Chapter 2)](#identification); [PTI preparation (Chapter 3)](#pti-prep); [Application (Chapter 4)](#application); and [Monitoring (Chapter 5)](#monitoring).
